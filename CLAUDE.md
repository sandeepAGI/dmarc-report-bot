Please start with reviewing the README.md and the code base
I have shared below an example of a report where an issue has been identified

"üö® DMARC ISSUES DETECTED - 2025-07-11 10:01:54
============================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
‚Ä¢ Total Reports Analyzed: 8
‚Ä¢ Reports with Issues: 1
‚Ä¢ Clean Reports: 7
‚Ä¢ Total Email Messages: 27
‚Ä¢ Average Authentication Rate: 80.6%

DOMAINS REQUIRING ATTENTION
============================================================

1. aileron-group.com (reported by Enterprise Outlook)
--------------------------------------------------
üìä Authentication Rate: 83.3% (10/12 messages)
üìà Historical Trend: Declined (-11.4% vs 30-day avg)
‚è∞ Report Period: 1751932800 to 1752019200

üîç ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. **Monitor DKIM Failures**:
  - Check if the 2 failed IPs continue showing DKIM issues in future reports
  - Verify DKIM signing configuration if pattern persists
  ‚Ä¢ ### Strategic Improvements
  2. **Consider Policy Upgrade**:
  - Current policy is "none" (monitoring only)
  - With 83%+ authentication success, consider moving to "quarantine" for enhanced security
  - Test thoroughly before implementing "reject" policy
  3. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
  - Continue monitoring monthly reports
  - Set alerts if DKIM failure rate exceeds 20%
  - Track any new source IPs outside Microsoft's infrastructure
  ‚Ä¢ The domain's email authentication is functioning well overall. The minor DKIM failures are likely temporary and don't pose immediate security risks.

The challenge is that the report doesn't share enough details on the fails to be able to take any action.
Please propose changes that we should consider making.
